# gifr

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LucyMcGowan/gifr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LucyMcGowan/gifr)

MAKE GIFS IN R!

## Installation

You can install gifr from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("LucyMcGowan/gifr")
```

You must have [`ffmpeg`](https://www.ffmpeg.org) and [`gifsicle`](https://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/) installed. This is super under contstruction, so at the moment, if you don't have those installed, it will probably just fail with no explanation. 

## Example

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
make_gif("input.mov", "output.gif")
```
